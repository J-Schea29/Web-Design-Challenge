## Introduction
### Summary
For this homework, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations that me and my team created in our fire-analysis group project. To do this I had to use HTML code and make use of Bootstrap.
### Requirements
* A landing page containing:
  1. An explanation of the project.
  2. Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* At least four visualization pages.
* A “Comparisons” page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
* A “Data” page that:
  1. Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  2. The table must be a bootstrap table component.
* The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
  1. Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  2. Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named “Visualizations” that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
  3. Provides text link on the right named “Data,” which links to the data page.
